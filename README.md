Chutes and Ladders Game
Project Overview
This project is a Python implementation of the classic board game "Chutes and Ladders." The game involves players moving from start to finish based on dice rolls, with the added twist of chutes (which cause players to slide down) and ladders (which allow players to climb up). The project is divided into multiple tasks, each focusing on a different feature of the game.

Task Breakdown
Task 1 - Setting Up the Game Environment:

Initializes the game environment, setting up the board, players, and any necessary components.
Task 2 - Implementing Basic Movement:
Implements the basic movement logic for the players. The number of steps a player moves is determined by dice rolls.

Task 3 - Handling Chutes and Ladders：
Adds the logic for chutes and ladders. When a player lands on a chute or ladder, they either slide down or climb up accordingly.

Task 4 - Implementing Turns:
Implements the turn-taking mechanism, ensuring players take turns to roll the dice and move.

Task 5 - The More The Merrier!:
Adds multi-player functionality, allowing more than one player to participate in the game.

Task 6 - Making the Game 'Functional':
Ensures the game can be played to completion. Defines the winning condition (e.g., the first player to reach the final square).

Task 7 - Adding a Little ✨ Magic ✨:
Introduces special features or effects to enhance the game experience, such as random events or special rules.
